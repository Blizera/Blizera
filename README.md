## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer who learned everything independently — no courses, no bootcamps, just building real things and figuring it out. I work across three domains: Roblox game development, full-stack web, and Discord bots. Most of my work lives in personal projects where I prototype, test, and refine systems until they're actually good.

## What I Build

**🎮 Roblox — Full Stack Game Development**
I build complete game systems in Luau, handling both server and client side. My work covers:
- Persistent data systems using DataStore with fallback handling
- Combat mechanics with server-authoritative hit validation
- Custom UI and menu systems built with Roblox's UI engine
- Admin tooling for moderation and runtime control
- Matchmaking and lobby systems with player queue management

**🌐 Web — Frontend Development**
I design and build websites completely from scratch in VSC — no templates, no builders. My focus is on making things that look and feel premium:
- Multi-page full sites with clean navigation and structure
- Motion-heavy interfaces with custom CSS animations
- Portfolio sites with strong visual identity and layout

**🤖 Discord Bots**
Functional, purpose-built bots for real use cases. Most notable is a full verification bot used in a live server.

## Where I'm At

I'm still learning — actively growing across all three stacks. Every project I build teaches me something new and I'm focused on writing cleaner, more scalable code over time.

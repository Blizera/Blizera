## About Me

I'm a CS Student, however I self taught developer most of what I've learned independently, no courses, no bootcamps, just building real things and figuring it out. I work across three domains: Roblox game development, full-stack web, and Discord bots. Most of my work lives in personal projects where I prototype, test, and refine systems until they're actually good.

## What I Build

**🎮 Roblox - Game Development**
I build complete game systems in Luau, handling both server and client side. My work covers:
- Persistent data systems using DataStore with fallback handling
- Combat mechanics with server-authoritative hit validation
- Custom UI and menu systems built with Roblox's UI engine
- Admin tooling for moderation and runtime control
- Matchmaking and lobby systems with player queue management
- Anti-cheat and exploit prevention systems synced to roblox server authority

**🌐 Web — Frontend Development**
I design and build websites completely from scratch in VSC, no templates, no helpers. My focus is on making things that look and feel unique:
- Multi-page full sites with clean navigation and structure
- Heavy interfaces with custom CSS animations
- Portfolio sites with strong visual designs and layout

**🤖 Discord Bots**
Functional, purpose built bots for real use cases. Most notable is a Roblox x Discord Anti-Cheat and exploit prevention detection bot.

## Where I'm At

I'm still learning while actively growing across all three stacks. Every project I build teaches me something new and I'm focused on writing cleaner, more scalable code over time.
